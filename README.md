# HypixelSkyBlockZealotCounter (HySbAa)

First of all: I used the following lib https://github.com/stleary/JSON-java

This is few-hours-project to create something that can tell how many zealots you have already killed.
It takes some time to update, but that is a small price to pay for avoiding the risk of using mods.
